# IMDb_Predictor
Takes movie data from CSV file to predict movies' IMDb score

***DISCLAIMER***
I do not own this dataset. The original dataset was pulled from: https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata in early 2017. The dataset has since changed and WILL NOT be compatible with the scripts in this repo.

software prerequisites- 
python (preferably 2.7.14)
pip install numpy (should be included with python)
pip install pandas
pip install gensim
pip install keras
pip install h5py

data prerequisites-
csv formatted with label names as first row and columns of values
advised that one label is "movie_title" and output label is "imdb_score"
advised dataset- https://github.com/gestalt-howard/IMDb_Predictor

pipeline order-
***IMPORTANT: Must run imdb_input_generator first since this is the script that will save the training and test data sets into either pickle or h5 files

imdb_input_generator-
	- Ensure that all target file paths are correct 
	- Takes CSV file contents and cleans the data of rows with null values 
	- Takes subset of remaining dataset and formats fields into binary vectors, normalized values, and word vector
	- Word vector embedding performed using Word2Vector from the gensim library

	
files generated-
word_model.bin-
	- Binary file generated by Word2Vector 
	- Model that contains contextual data from training phrases 
	- Model is generated by imdb_input_generator and also referenced by imdb_input_generator to embed contextual information into word vectors
